        <h4>How I Got Here and Where am I Going...</h4>
        <p>I cannot wait to begin learning this powerful skill set at Galvanize's WDI program. I decided to take this step because I was both frustrated with my inability to take an idea beyond just that and saw the incredibly large impact I could have as a web developer. I want to learn how to get things done in this rapidly changing world. The opportunities seem endless.</p>
        <p>If I had to choose the type of project I want to work on most, it would be in the government/civic/politics realm.</p>
        <p>However, whenever I take the next step, I end up redefining my goals. I can't wait for this to happen while I am studying at Galvanize!</p>
